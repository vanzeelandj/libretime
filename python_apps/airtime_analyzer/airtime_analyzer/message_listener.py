""" A message listener class that waits for messages from Airtime through RabbitMQ
    notifying us about new uploads.
    
    This is probably the most important class in this application. It connects
    to RabbitMQ (or an AMQP server) and listens for messages that notify us
    when a user uploads a new file to Airtime, either through the web interface
    or via FTP (on Airtime Pro). When we get a notification, we spawn a child
    process that extracts the uploaded audio file's metadata and moves it into
    Airtime's music library directory. Lastly, the extracted metadata is 
    reported back to the Airtime web application.
    
    There's a couple of Very Important technical details and constraints that you
    need to know if you're going to work on this code:
    
    1) airtime_analyzer is designed so it doesn't have to run on the same 
       computer as the web server. It just needs access to your Airtime library
       folder (stor). 
    2) airtime_analyzer is multi-tenant - One process can be used for many
       Airtime instances. It's designed NOT to know about whether it's running
       in a single tenant or multi-tenant environment. All the information it 
       needs to import a file into an Airtime instance is passed in via those
       RabbitMQ messages.
    3) We're using a "topic exchange" for the new upload notification RabbitMQ
       messages. This means if we run several airtime_analyzer processes on 
       different computers, RabbitMQ will do round-robin dispatching of the
       file notification. This is cheap, easy load balancing and
       redundancy for us. You can even run multiple airtime_analyzer processes
       on one machine if you want.
    4) We run the actual work (metadata analysis and file moving) in a separate
       child process so that if it crashes, we can stop RabbitMQ from resending
       the file notification message to another airtime_analyzer process (NACK), 
       which would otherwise cause cascading failure. We also do this so that we 
       can report the problem file to the Airtime web interface ("import failed").

    So that is a quick overview of the design constraints for this application, and
    why airtime_analyzer is written this way.
