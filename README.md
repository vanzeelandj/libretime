LibreTime makes it easy to run your own online or terrestrial radio station. It
is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.

It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations from around the
globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. Join us in fixing bugs and in
defining how we manage the codebase going forward.

We are currently ramping up development on this repository.

Check out the [documentation](https://libretime.org) for more information and
start broadcasting!

## Development Process

The LibreTime follows the standardized [Collective Code Construction
Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/). Its abstract is
provided here.

> C4 provides a standard process for contributing, evaluating and
> discussing improvements on software projects. It defines specific
> technical requirements for projects like a style guide, unit tests,
> git and similar platforms. It also establishes different personas
> for projects, with clear and distinct duties. C4 specifies a process
> for documenting and discussing issues including seeking consensus
> and clear descriptions, use of "pull requests" and systematic reviews.

The full text of the contract is licensed under the GPL and available at
the above link courtesy of the [ZeroMQ community](https://zeromq.org/).

## Releasing

The LibreTime maintainers release new versions of LibreTime at regular
intervals. We follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
standards.

In a nutshell, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH we increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Given the history of the project we will be starting with version 3.0.0.

Stay tuned for early alphas and lots of betas as we get development
up and running.

## Support

To get support for any questions or problems you might have using the software
we have a forum at [discourse.libretime.org](https://discourse.libretime.org).
We are moving towards using the forum to provide community support and reserving
the github issue queue for confirmed bugs and well-formed feature requests.

You can also contact us through our [Mattermost instance](https://chat.libretime.org)
where you can talk with other users and developers.
