# Contributing to LibreTime

First and foremost, thank you! We appreciate that you want to
contribute to LibreTime, your time is valuable, and your 
contributions mean a lot to us.

**What does "contributing" mean?**

Creating an issue is the simplest form of contributing to a
project. But there are many ways to contribute, including 
the following:

* Updating or correcting documentation
* Feature requests
* Bug reports

Before opening an issue, please:

* read and be prepared to adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/LibreTime/code-of-conduct/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* understand that we follow the standardized [C4 development process](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/)
* [search for existing duplicate or closed issues](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
* clearly state the problem you would like to solve in a meaningful way
* be prepared to follow up on issues by providing additional information as requested by a maintainer or contributor helping you out

For bug reports, please provide the following details:

* **version**: what version of LibreTime you were using when you experienced the bug?
* **distro**: what distribution is your install on and which distro version are you using (ie. Ubuntu Trusty)
* **reduced test case**: the minimum amount of detail needed to reproduce the bug
* **error messages**: please paste any error reports into the issue or a gist

Please wrap all code and error messages in [markdown code
