On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings</span> menu, click **General** to set your **Station Name**. This text is shown in your web browser's title bar when your station staff are logged into Libretime, and optionally in stream metadata. You can also set a **Station Description** and **Station Logo** here.
You can enable live, read-only access to the Libretime schedule calendar for your station's public website with the **Allow Remote Websites to Access "Schedule" Info?** option, if you wish. (There is more about this feature in the *Exporting the schedule* chapter, in the *Advanced Configuration* section of this book).

Initially, the **Default Fade In** and **Default Fade Out** times for automated fades are set to half a second, and the **Default Crossfade Duration** is set to zero seconds. Custom fade and crossfade times can be set for adjacent items in a playlist or static smart block. See the chapter *Library* for details. Â 

The **Default Interface Language** drop-down menu sets the default localization for your Libretime instance, and the **Station Timezone** drop-down menu can be used to display local time at your station. Libretime stores show times internally in UTC format (similar to *Greenwich Mean Time*), but displays local time for the convenience of your station staff. You can also set the day of the week that you wish to start your station's weekly schedule on, which defaults to Sunday. Then click the **Save** button.

Individual Libretime users can choose another interface localization when they log in, or set personal preferences for localization and time zone by clicking their username on the right side of the menu bar.
