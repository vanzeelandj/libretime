The Podcasts page allows you add subscriptions to podcasts which are often used to syndicated audio files using a URL called a RSS feed. This allows your LibreTime instance to automatically download new shows from the web.

In order to add a podcast you need to get the RSS feed. All podcasts available on iTunes have a RSS feed but it is sometimes hidden. See this issue on our github page [#510](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues/510) for more information. RSS feeds that do not end in *.xml* may be accepted by LibreTime but might fail to download episodes; in that case, download the episode using a podcast client such as [gpodder](https://gpodder.github.io/) and then manually upload and schedule the episode. Podcast feeds coming from Anchor.fm have been known to have this issue.

The podcast interfaces provides you with the ability generate [Smartblocks](../smartblocks) that can be used in conjunction with [Autoloading Playlists](../calendar/#autoloading-playlist) to schedule the newest episode of a podcast without human intervention.
