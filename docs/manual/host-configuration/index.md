The streaming host configuration for Libretime is shown in the file */etc/airtime/liquidsoap.cfg* which is automatically generated by the **Streams** page, found on the **System** menu of the Libretime administration interface. For this reason, you would not normally edit the streaming configuration manually, as any changes are likely to be overwritten by the administration interface.

Database and RabbitMQ hosts
---------------------------

Optionally, you may wish to edit the file */etc/airtime/airtime.conf* to set the PostgreSQL database host, and the username and password to connect to the database with:

    sudo nano /etc/airtime/airtime.conf

You can also set options for RabbitMQ messaging, the Libretime server and SoundCloud uploads in this file, although you should not normally need to adjust the defaults unless you are running a large Libretime system distributed across multiple servers. To run the Libretime server in demo mode, which changes the greeting on the login page and prevents user accounts from being created or modified, set the value of *demo* to 1.

    [database]
    host = localhost
    dbname = airtime
    dbuser = airtime
    dbpass = airtime

    [rabbitmq]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5672
    user = airtime
    password = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    vhost = /airtime

    [general]
    api_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    web_server_user = www-data
    airtime_dir = /usr/share/airtime
    base_url = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /
    cache_ahead_hours = 1

    [monit]
    monit_user = guest
    monit_password = airtime

    [soundcloud]
    connection_retries = 3
    time_between_retries = 60

    [demo]
    demo = 0

Save and close the file with **Ctrl+O** and **Ctrl+X**. If you have changed the database settings, you should now run the command:

    sudo airtime-update-db-settings

to make sure all of Libretime's database configuration files are updated. This command should output the following text to the server console:

    Libretime root folder found at /usr/share/airtime
    Updating /usr/share/airtime/application/configs/application.ini
    Updating /usr/share/airtime/build/build.properties
    Updating /usr/share/airtime/build/runtime-conf.xml
    Success!
	

API client configuration
------------------------

If you have changed the *base\_url*, *base\_port* or *base\_dir* setting in */etc/airtime/airtime.conf* from the defaults, you will probably also have to update the *Hostname* settings in the file */etc/airtime/api\_client.cfg* accordingly.**

    bin_dir = /usr/lib/airtime/api_clients
    api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    api_base = api
    host = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /


Playout and recorder settings
-----------------------------

Settings for pypo, the playout and recording engine used by Libretime, are found in the file */etc/airtime/airtime.conf*. After making changes to this file, you will have to issue the command:

    sudo /etc/init.d/airtime-playout restart

for the changes to take effect.
