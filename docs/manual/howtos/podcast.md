Scheduling a podcast as a repeating show

Click on **Calendar**

Add a new show or edit a pre-existing show setup for this podcast.

Check the time & click repeats and check the appropriate days of the
week it should run.

If it needs to run at different times of the day you will need to add a
separate show for this.

Click the drop-down next to Autoloading playlist.

Check the box next to Add Autoloading Playlist.

Now we select the playlist with the podcast name we created above.

Now click Add This Show and it should be added to your Calendar.

One hour before your show is set to air the latest podcast will be
added.

To add other tracks to play along with this show edit the playlist with
the podcast name. Any tracks or smartblocks added to this playlist will
be scheduled along with this playlist.

To add tracks before or after all autoloading playlists see **How to use
Intro and Outro Playlist feature**
