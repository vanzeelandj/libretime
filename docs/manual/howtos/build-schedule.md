How to build a basic schedule with LibreTime

a description of the steps involved in adding a show to the LibreTime
calendar schedule for future playback including repeating shows

Audience: Program Managers and Admins

Click on the Calendar menu item on the left side of the screen

Click on the blue New Show button

Under **What** - type in a Name to replace Untitled Show

Optional â€“ add URL, Genre and Description

Under **When** click **In The Future**

Select a date and time for the **Start Time** and **End Time**

Time is entered as 00:00 where the first 2 digits are the hour in
military time and the second 2 digits are the minutes. So 15:00 is 3PM.

Note: 24 hours is the maximum show time and Midnight is 00:00 of the
next date.

Click **Repeats** if this show will air more than once.

If it airs at the same time of the day on more than one day of the week
then check the boxes next to the Days it should repeat on.

If this is a limited engagement show uncheck **No End?** and select the
date at which this show should no longer be on the schedule.

**Autoloading Playlist** is used if you will generate the content for
this show using a playlist possibly containing smartblocks to
dynamically generate it.

Basically if this is checked and a playlist is selected LibreTime will
schedule it an hour before the show is set to air as well as any **Intro
& Outro Playlist** configured in the Admin settings.

See other How Tos for ideas about how to use AutoLoading playlists.

Live Stream Input contains the streaming information for DJs and if Use
LibreTime Authentication is checked then DJs can login to stream live if
they are added to the Who section.

Who is where you can give DJ users permission to schedule tracks for
this show and stream live during the show spot. You can check the box
next to them or type their name and click the drop down.

Style allows you to select a custom color and add a show Logo for this
show.
