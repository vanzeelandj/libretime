The Libretime API enables many types of information about the broadcast schedule and configuration to be retrieved from the Libretime server. Other than the live-info and week-info data fetched by website widgets (see the chapter *Exporting the schedule*), all API requests must be authenticated using the secret API key stored in the file */etc/airtime/api\_client.cfg* on the Libretime server. This key is autogenerated during Libretime installation and should be unique for each server.

If you intend to use the Libretime API across a public network, for security reasons it is highly recommended that all API requests are sent over encrypted https: and that the web server is configured to accept requests to the api/ directory from specific host names or IP addresses only.

The format of API requests is:

    https://libretime.example.com/api/api-action/format/json/api_key/XXXXXX

where api-action is the type of request and XXXXXX is the secret API key. Available actions include:

-   on-air-light - return true if the station is on air
-   status - get the status of Libretime components and resource usage
-   version - returns the version of Libretime installed
-   get-files-without-silan-value - list files for which silence detection has not yet been performed
-   get-stream-setting - gets the settings of Libretime output streams
-   get-stream-parameters - gets the parameters of Libretime output streams

For example, using the action *get-stream-setting* returns the following output for the first configured stream:

    {"keyname":"s1_type","value":"ogg","type":"string"},

    {"keyname":"s1_host","value":"streaming.example.com","type":"string"},

    {"keyname":"s1_port","value":"8000","type":"integer"},

    {"keyname":"s1_mount","value":"airtime_128","type":"string"},

    {"keyname":"s1_url","value":"http:\/\/airtime.sourcefabric.org","type":"string"},

    {"keyname":"s1_description","value":"Airtime Radio! Stream
    #1","type":"string"},

    {"keyname":"s1_genre","value":"Screamo","type":"string"},

which is enough information to construct a player widget dynamically. (s1\_url is the station's homepage, not the stream URL). The same information is provided with an s2\_ prefix for the second stream, and s3\_ prefix for the third stream.

Some API requests require the directory ID number to be specified as *dir\_id* including:

-   list-all-files - list files in the specified directory
-   get-files-without-replay-gain - list files in the specified directory for which ReplayGain has not been calculated yet

For example, using a request such as:

     http://libretime.example.com/api/list-all-files/format/json/api_key/XXXXXX/dir_id/1/

returns the full path to each media file in the Libretime storage directory:

    {"files":[
    "imported\/1\/Mark Ronson feat. Saigon\/Here Comes the Fuzz\/7-Diduntdidunt-unknown.flac",
    "imported\/1\/Jimi Tenor & Tony Allen\/Inspiration Information\/3-Selfish Gene-128kbps.mp3",
    "]}
