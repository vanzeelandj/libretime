title: Host Configuration
layout: article

The streaming host configuration for LibreTime is shown in the file _/etc/airtime/liquidsoap.cfg_ which is automatically generated by the **Streams** page, found on the **System** menu of the LibreTime administration interface. For this reason, you would not normally edit the streaming configuration manually, as any changes are likely to be overwritten by the administration interface.

## Database and RabbitMQ hosts {#database}

Optionally, you may wish to edit the file _/etc/airtime/airtime.conf_ to set the PostgreSQL database host, and the username and password to connect to the database with:

    sudo nano /etc/airtime/airtime.conf

You can also set options for RabbitMQ messaging and the LibreTime server in this file, although you should not normally need to adjust the defaults unless you are running a large LibreTime system distributed across multiple servers. To run the LibreTime server in demo mode, which changes the greeting on the login page and prevents user accounts from being created or modified, set the value of _demo_ to 1.

    [database]
    host = localhost
    dbname = airtime
    dbuser = airtime
    dbpass = airtime

    [rabbitmq]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5672
    user = airtime
    password = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    vhost = /airtime

    [general]
    api_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    web_server_user = www-data
    airtime_dir = /usr/share/airtime
    base_url = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /
    cache_ahead_hours = 1

    [monit]
    monit_user = guest
    monit_password = airtime

    [demo]
    demo = 0

Save and close the file with **Ctrl+O** and **Ctrl+X**. In order to update the configuration
used by the various components of LibreTime, run the following commands

    sudo systemctl restart libretime-liquidsoap
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-playout
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-celery
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-analyzer

## API client configuration {#api}

The LibreTime API enables many types of information about the broadcast schedule and configuration to be retrieved from the LibreTime server. Other than the live-info and week-info data fetched by website widgets (see the chapter _Exporting the schedule_), all API requests must be authenticated using the secret API key stored in the file _/etc/airtime/api_client.cfg_ on the LibreTime server. This key is autogenerated during LibreTime installation and should be unique for each server.

If you intend to use the LibreTime API across a public network, for security reasons it is highly recommended that all API requests are sent over encrypted https: and that the web server is configured to accept requests to the api/ directory from specific host names or IP addresses only.

If you have changed the _base_url_, _base_port_ or _base_dir_ setting in _/etc/airtime/airtime.conf_ from the defaults, you will probably also have to update the _Hostname_ settings in the file _/etc/airtime/api_client.cfg_ accordingly.\*\*

    bin_dir = /usr/lib/airtime/api_clients
    api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    api_base = api
    host = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /

## Apache max file size configuration {#apache}

By default, the maximum upload file size is 40 MB, which may not be large enough for some stations, especially if they are uploading prerecorded shows. The setting for this is located in _/etc/apache2/sites-available/airtime.config_. Search for and update the following in megabytes:

```
; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 40M

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
post_max_size = 40M
```

For quick reference, 1024 MB = 1 GB and 2048 MB = 2 GB, but most will be okay with rounding to the nearest thousand. After updating the config file, restart Apache.

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Playout settings {#playout}

Settings for pypo, the playout engine used by LibreTime, are found in the file _/etc/airtime/airtime.conf_. After making changes to this file, you will have to issue the command:

    sudo systemctl restart libretime-playout

for the changes to take effect.

## RabbitMQ hostname changes

If the Airtime logs indicate failures to connect to the RabbitMQ server, such as:

```
2013-10-31 08:21:11,255 ERROR - [pypomessagehandler.py : main() : line
99] - Error connecting to RabbitMQ Server. Trying again in few seconds

2013-10-31 08:21:11,255 ERROR - \[pypomessagehandler.py : main() : line 99\] - Error connecting to RabbitMQ Server. Trying again in few seconds - See more at: http://forum.sourcefabric.org/discussion/16050/\#sthash.W8OJrNFm.dpuf
```

but the RabbitMQ server is running normally, this error might be due to a change in the server's hostname since Libretime installation. Directory names under _/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/_ indicate that RabbitMQ's database files are organised according to the hostname of the server (ex. `rabbit@airtime`) where the hostname is _airtime.example.com_. If the hostname has changed, it may be necessary to reconfigure RabbitMQ manually, as follows:

1. Delete the files in _/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/_

```
sudo rm -r /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/*
```

2. Restart RabbitMQ:

```
sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
```

3. Enter the following commands to set up authentication and grant permissions. The _rabbitmqctl add_user_ command requires the RabbitMQ password from the /etc/airtime/airtime.conf file as an argument. The _rabbitmqctl set_permissions_ command should be entered on one line, with the list of Airtime services repeated three times:

```
rabbitmqctl add_vhost /airtime
rabbitmqctl add_user airtime XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /airtime airtime
   "airtime-pypo|pypo-fetch|airtime-analyzer|media-monitor"
   "airtime-pypo|pypo-fetch|airtime-analyzer|media-monitor"
   "airtime-pypo|pypo-fetch|airtime-analyzer|media-monitor"
```
