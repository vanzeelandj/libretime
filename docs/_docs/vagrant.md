> Prerequisites: git, [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com), libvirt or VirtualBox

## VirtualBox

You will need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and may want to consider
installing [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) to update the
guest extensions to match your host system on vagrant up.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

## Libvirt

Setting the libvirt provider up on Ubuntu and Debian is straight-forward,
using the distribution provided packages. While on
other distributions it can be built from within vagrant.

If you try run a libvirt provided box after using a VirtualBox one, you will receive an
error:

```
Error while activating network:
Call to virNetworkCreate failed: internal error: Network is already in use by interface vboxnet0.
```

This is fixed by stopping virtualbox and re-creating the vagrant box:

```
sudo systemctl stop virtualbox
vagrant destroy ubuntu-xenial
vagrant up ubuntu-xenial --provider=libvirt
```

### Debian and Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install vagrant vagrant-libvirt libvirt-daemon-system vagrant-mutate libvirt-dev
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER

# Reboot

vagrant box add bento/ubuntu-16.04 --provider=virtualbox
vagrant mutate bento/ubuntu-16.04 libvirt
vagrant up ubuntu-xenial --provider=libvirt
```

### Other Distributions

You will need to install [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) and `vagrant-mutate` and then run

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $USER

# Reboot

vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate
vagrant box fetch bento/ubuntu-16.04
vagrant mutate bento/ubuntu-16.04 libvirt
vagrant up ubuntu-xenial --provider=libvirt
```

## Starting LibreTime Vagrant

To get started you clone the repo and run `vagrant up`. The command accepts a parameter to
change the default provider if you have multiple installed. This can be done by appending
`--provider=virtualbox` or `--provider=libvirt` as applicable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libretime/libretime.git
cd libretime
vagrant up ubuntu-xenial
```

If everything works out, you will find LibreTime on [port 8080](http://localhost:8080)
and Icecast on [port 8000](http://localhost:8000).

Once you reach the web setup GUI you can click through it using the default values. To
connect to the vagrant machine you can run `vagrant ssh ubuntu-xenial` in the libretime
directory.

## Alternative OS installations

With the above instructions LibreTime is installed on Ubuntu Xenial Xerus. The Vagrant setup
offers the option to choose a different operation system according to you needs.

| OS           | Command                    | Comment                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debian 10    | `vagrant up debian-buster` | Install on Debian Buster.                                   |
| Ubuntu 18.04 | `vagrant up ubuntu-bionic` | Install on Ubuntu Bionic Beaver.                            |
| Ubuntu 16.04 | `vagrant up ubuntu-xenial` | Install on Ubuntu Xenial Xerus.                             |
| CentOS       | `vagrant up centos`        | CentOS 8 with native systemd support and activated SELinux. |

## Troubleshooting

If anything fails during the initial provisioning step you can try running `vagrant provision`
to re-run the installer.

If you only want to re-run parts of the installer, use `--provision-with $step`. The
supported steps are `prepare` and `install`.
