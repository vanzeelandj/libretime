On the **Settings** menu, the **Status** page provides an overview of the health and resource usage of the various
services that make up a LibreTime system. If all is well, you will only see green check mark icons in the
**Status** column. This page also shows how much **Disk Space** you have used on the disk partition containing the media storage folder.

If any of the check mark icons in the **Status** column have changed to a red warning sign, contact your system
administrator for assistance. (The chapter [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) contains some tips). LibreTime will
do its best to restart any failing services, but sometimes manual intervention may be required; for example, in the case of hardware failure.

If you have run out of storage space, a LibreTime user with *admin* privileges could log in and delete media files
that are no longer required from the **Library**. Alternatively, you could ask your system administrator to install additional storage capacity.
