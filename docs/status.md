# The Status page

On the **Settings** menu, the **Status** page provides an overview of the health and resource usage of the various
services that make up a LibreTime system. If all is well, you will only see green check mark icons in the
**Status** column. This page also shows how much **Disk Space** you have used on the disk partition containing
the main Import folder, as well as any disks or partitions with watched folders.

If any of the check mark icons in the **Status** column have changed to a red warning sign, contact your system
administrator for assistance. (The chapter [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting) contains some tips). LibreTime will
do its best to restart any failing services, but sometimes manual intervention may be required; for example, in
the case of hardware failure.

If you have run out of storage space, a LibreTime user with *admin* privileges could log in and delete media files
that are no longer required from the **Library**. Alternatively, you could move some files to a watched folder on
another disk, or ask your system administrator to install additional storage capacity.
