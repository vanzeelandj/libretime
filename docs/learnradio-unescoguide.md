# Radio Broadcasting 101 - UNESCO Public Radio Guide

The UNESCO publication [*Community Radio - A user's guide to the technology*](img/CommunityRadioUserGuide.pdf)
features a very comprehensive guide to setting up a community radio station.
This guide is aimed at people thinking about setting up a radio station in
India, but includes lots of practical advice that would be useful in any
country.

More guides will be coming soon. Don't touch that dial!
