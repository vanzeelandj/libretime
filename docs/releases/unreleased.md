### Apache and PHP configuration files

The Apache configuration file has been updated and renamed, in addition the PHP configuration has been merged in the Apache configuration. The old configuration files must be removed from the system **before the upgrade procedure**:

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu systems
sudo rm -f /etc/apache2/sites-*/airtime*
sudo rm -f /etc/php/*/apache2/conf.d/airtime.ini

# On CentOS systems
sudo rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/airtime*
sudo rm -f /etc/php.d/airtime.ini
```

### Replaced uWSGI with Gunicorn

[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io) was replaced by [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), the packages and configuration file should be removed from the system:

```bash
# Remove the configuration file
sudo rm -f /etc/airtime/libretime-api.ini

# Remove the packages
sudo apt purge \
    uwsgi \
    uwsgi-plugin-python3
```

### New configuration schema

The configuration schema was updated.

The `general` section has been changed:

- theÂ `general.protocol`, `general.base_url`, `general.base_port`, `general.base_dir` and `general.force_ssl` entries were replaced with a single `general.public_url` entry, be sure to use a valid url with the new configuration entry.
