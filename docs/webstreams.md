The Webstreams page
-------------------

## Adding a webstream
A web stream URL and metadata can be added to the LibreTime library, so that a remote stream can be searched for and scheduled to be *pulled* into a show. For example, at the top of the hour your station may pull a news report from journalists working in another studio. This is a different concept from **Master Source** and **Show Source** remote streams which are *pushed* into the LibreTime playout schedule.

To add a web stream, click the **+ New** button on the left side of the Webstreams page. Like a playlist, web streams in the Library can have a title and **Description**, which may help you find them in searches later.

The **Stream URL** setting must include the *port number* (such as 8000) and *mount point* (such as remote\_stream) of the remote stream, in addition to the streaming server name. A **Default Length** for the remote stream can also be set. If the stream is added at the end of a show which becomes overbooked as a result, it will be faded out when the show ends.

Note: LibreTime checks the remote webstream's status upon editing stream settings, so an offline stream will result in an error. There are many tools such as [BUTT](https://danielnoethen.de/butt/) and [MIXXX](https://www.mixxx.org) that can be used to send a test stream to LibreTime can save it; read more [here](../live-shows-with-mixxx/index.md).
