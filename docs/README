# Contributing to the docs

**Note:** External components for the website (Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome etc.) are
now being served from CDNs instead of from the repo itself. You must be connected to the internet in order to test the site.

## Running Jekyll

Follow [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Ruby, then:

```
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Install Jekyll dependencies
cd docs  #must run in docs folder
bundler install

# Run Jekyll server
jekyll serve
```

## Where to find things

|-- /_includes -> the equilivant of components, can be inserted into HTML files
|-- /_layouts -> the HTML styling templates that make up each page
