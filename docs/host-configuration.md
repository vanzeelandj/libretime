Host configuration
------------------

The streaming host configuration for LibreTime is shown in the file */etc/airtime/liquidsoap.cfg* which is automatically generated by the **Streams** page, found on the **System** menu of the LibreTime administration interface. For this reason, you would not normally edit the streaming configuration manually, as any changes are likely to be overwritten by the administration interface.

Database and RabbitMQ hosts
---------------------------

Optionally, you may wish to edit the file */etc/airtime/airtime.conf* to set the PostgreSQL database host, and the username and password to connect to the database with:

    sudo nano /etc/airtime/airtime.conf

You can also set options for RabbitMQ messaging, the LibreTime server and SoundCloud uploads in this file, although you should not normally need to adjust the defaults unless you are running a large LibreTime system distributed across multiple servers. To run the LibreTime server in demo mode, which changes the greeting on the login page and prevents user accounts from being created or modified, set the value of *demo* to 1.

    [database]
    host = localhost
    dbname = airtime
    dbuser = airtime
    dbpass = airtime

    [rabbitmq]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5672
    user = airtime
    password = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    vhost = /airtime

    [general]
    api_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    web_server_user = www-data
    airtime_dir = /usr/share/airtime
    base_url = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /
    cache_ahead_hours = 1

    [monit]
    monit_user = guest
    monit_password = airtime

    [soundcloud]
    connection_retries = 3
    time_between_retries = 60

    [demo]
    demo = 0

Save and close the file with **Ctrl+O** and **Ctrl+X**.  In order to update the configuration
used by the various components of LibreTime, run the following commands

    sudo systemctl restart libretime-liquidsoap
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-playout
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-celery
    sudo systemctl restart libretime-analyzer

Changing the default PostgreSQL passwords
----------------------------------------

Two of the most important passwords that should be changed *immediately* after installation
are the passwords used by the PostgreSQL database.
It is strongly recommended that you do this before exposing your server to the internet beyond your internal network.

1. Login to PostgreSQL with `sudo -u postgres psql`. The PostgreSQL shell - `postgres=#` - means that you have logged in successfully.
2. Change the admin password with `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'myPassword';`, where `myPassword` is the new password.
Make sure to include the semicolon at the end! A response of `ALTER ROLE` means that the command ran successfully.
3. Change the password for the *airtime* user with `ALTER USER airtime WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';`
A response of `ALTER ROLE` means that the command ran successfully.
4. If all is successful, logout of PostgreSQL with `\q`, go back to */etc/airtime/airtime.conf* to edit the password
in the config file, and restart all services mentioned in the previous section.

API client configuration
------------------------

If you have changed the *base\_url*, *base\_port* or *base\_dir* setting in */etc/airtime/airtime.conf* from the defaults, you will probably also have to update the *Hostname* settings in the file */etc/airtime/api\_client.cfg* accordingly.**

    bin_dir = /usr/lib/airtime/api_clients
    api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    api_base = api
    host = libretime.example.com
    base_port = 80
    base_dir = /

Apache max file size configuration
----------------------------------

By default, the maximum upload file size is 500 MB, which may not be large enough for some stations, especially if they are uploading prerecorded shows. The setting for this is located in */etc/apache2/sites-available/airtime.config*. Search for and update the following in megabytes:

```
; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 40M

; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize
post_max_size = 40M
```

For quick reference, 1024 MB = 1 GB and 2048 MB = 2 GB, but most will be okay with rounding to the nearest thousand. After updating the config file, restart Apache by `sudo systemctl apache restart`.


Playout and recorder settings
-----------------------------

Settings for pypo, the playout and recording engine used by LibreTime, are found in the file */etc/airtime/airtime.conf*. After making changes to this file, you will have to issue the command:

    sudo systemctl restart libretime-playout

for the changes to take effect.
