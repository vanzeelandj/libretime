Uninstall LibreTime
-------------------

Hopefully it wasn't something that we did, but if you need to uninstall LibreTime for
any reason, cd to the directory of the installer and run `sudo ./uninstall` and follow the prompts.
If allowed, the installer will **permanently** delete all databases and media uploaded to
LibreTime.

If it was something we did, please open an issue request on our Github page, located
[here](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues).

Until we meet again, best of luck.
