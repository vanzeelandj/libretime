To update the Airtime translations:

- Make sure you run bootstrap_development_environment.sh as root once to set up this magic git merge driver for PO files.
- Run update_po_files.sh
- Commit the updated files.
- Push to GitHub.
- Transifex will then pick up the updated files in about 24 hours, and they'll be available for translation there.
- After translators have updated strings, they'll be automatically downloaded and committed to our git repo by
  a script running here at Sourcefabric (contact Andrey).
